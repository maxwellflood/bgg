prodRules:
All players start at the first hole as marked out by the numbered cones. Each player needs to carry with them their scorecard to note down their scores. The aim of the game is to put the golf ball into the hole in as few attempts as possible. Players must complete each hole in order without skipping any holes. Players can only use the head of their putter to put the ball into the hole and must put from the tee off area. Once the ball is potted it is important to take note at each hole how many attempts it took to put the ball at each hole. The player with the lowest score is the winner. For example, if a player scores a hole in one at every hole on a 9 hole course, their score will be 9.
