prodRules: 
To start the game the ball must be dropped into the centre circle with no spin put on the ball. Throughout the course of the game players must not spin. A spin is when the rod completes a 360 degree rotation without touching the ball. Itâ€™s not only against the rules but considered pretty bad form as well! You are also not allowed to jar which involves jamming the rods as a distraction unless you are not in possession and are defending. If the ball ever goes dead, the ball must be picked up and re-entered onto the pitch. You cannot shake or move the table to get the ball back into play. The first player or team to score 10 goals is the winner
