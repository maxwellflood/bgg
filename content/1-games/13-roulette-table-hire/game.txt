prodRules: 
The rules of roulette are purposefully simple to keep guests entertained at the roulette table. The roulette wheel has 37 numbers which provides a wide range of betting options. Simple ‘outside bets’ on red or black, odd or even and larger pay-outs on the numbers ‘straight up’. 
Betting on the ‘inside’ refers to betting on numbers or splits or sections of numbers and these payout at higher odds. The best payout can be attained through betting on a single number which pays at 35/1. You can bet on 2 particular numbers at odds of 17/1, a set of 3 particular numbers at odds of 11/1, a set of 4 particular numbers at odds of 8/1 or a group of 6 numbers at 5/1.
