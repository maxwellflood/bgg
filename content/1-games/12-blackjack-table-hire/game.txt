prodRules: 
In blackjack your aim is to gain a better blackjack hand than the house [croupier] and the house only. You do not need to beat the other players. This game is great for team building casino events once you all start working together to beat the house. The best hand in blackjack is 21 which can only be achieved by having an Ace [worth 11 or 1] and a card worth 10 [10, J, Q, K]. This totals 21 which is the key to this game If you have closer to 21 than the dealer you win. Just donâ€™t go over 21 or else you go bust.
