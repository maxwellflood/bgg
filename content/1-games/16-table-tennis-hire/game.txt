prodRules: 
To start the game of table tennis the server must throw the ball vertically, at least 16cm, up in the air using an open palm, without spinning the ball. The server then hits the table tennis ball so that it touches her section of the court first, passes over the net and then lands in the receiver’s half of the court. There are various ways to score points once in a rally; Points can be scored if the opponent fails to make a correct service, fails to make a return, the ball touches any part of an opponent’s body, strikes the ball twice in succession, or your opponent touches the playing surface or net during a rally. Every 2 points the server swaps and the winner is the player to attain 11 points first but must win by a 2 point or more difference. Much like tennis the games lead to sets and winners are determined by the most sets won.
