prodRules: 
Well we may be here all day to explain the rules of Chess! The set up of the board is probably very important as a start, but we will set this up correctly on delivery for you. From there certain pieces can only move in certain directions and players take it in turn to move them. The aim is to take the King [the largest piece on the board]. Our recommendation is to hold onto your Queen for as long as possible! It’s the most useful piece on the board as it is allowed to move in all directions.
