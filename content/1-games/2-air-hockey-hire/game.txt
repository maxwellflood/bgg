prodRules: 
Air Hockey is a 2 player game where players are trying to score by landing the puck in the gap at the end of the table. Players must stand on their side of the centreline and can not cross it. Players are only allowed to touch the puck with their pusher (so no hands, clothing or anything else may come into contact with the air hockey puck. At no point are players allowed to trap the air hockey puck, they must only make contact with the puck on the side of the pusher. For goals to be scored the puck must remain in the goal, bounce outs do not count. Once a goal is scored the player who conceded starts the game. The first to 7 is the winner unless playing a timed game. Timed games require players in possession to make a shot within 7 seconds of being in possession of the air hockey puck.
