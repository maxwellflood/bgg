prodDesc:Our giant connect 4 is a beautifully crafted wooden giant connect 4 set. A mainstay of summer garden events, office summer parties and summer evenings at home. Connect 4 is much better played in a giant version providing fun for children and adults alike as part of a garden games hire package. We can also create bespoke discs for events so if you are planning to retain a momento from the special day or have a product launch this is a great interactive game for guests.

prodRules: 
A game best played between 2 players, but can be played in teams of 2. The objective of the game is to make a row of 4 with the discs vertically, diagonally or horizontally on the connect 4 board. Players take it in turn to drop their discs into the board. Another simple game but brilliantly entertaining.
