prodRules: 
Every Pinball Machine has a different set of rules. The beauty of pinball machines is that they are all unique. It's much like playing a computer game before the digital revolution turned gaming on its head. Certain objectives need to be achieved to progress whilst playing certain pinball machines and they are usually available on the machine. Most pinball games are the traditional 3 ball game and you have to accumulate the most amount of points available using those 3 balls. During the course of the game however, depending on your success additional balls and multi balls may be added during gameplay. There is a huge amount of skill in pinball to understand how to make the best shots using both the left and right flipper. Like every great game though, practice makes perfect.
