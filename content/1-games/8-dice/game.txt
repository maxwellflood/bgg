prodRules: 
For details on the rules to playing craps we recommend booking a table. It is truly the only way to learn. Craps is essentially betting on the roll of 2 dice. Craps is a multi-layered game with plenty of betting options. This is the game that requires heavy participation from the fun casino guests through whooping and hollering when ‘the shooter’ rolls good. Still a house game where you are playing against the casino [house] but one where all can win big when pressing their bets. For details on the rules we recommend booking a table. It is truly the only way to learn.
